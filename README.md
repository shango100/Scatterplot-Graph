## Overview

The Cyclist Data Visualization project displays a scatter plot representing cyclist data. It uses D3.js for creating the scatter plot, scales, axes, tooltips, and legends. The chart is centered on the page, and dots are colored differently based on doping allegations.

## Features

- **Title and Heading**: The chart has a title "Cyclist Data Visualization" and an H1 heading for better context.

- **Axes**: The x-axis and y-axis are generated using the D3 axis property, providing a clear reference for the data points.

- **Responsive Design**: The chart is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, making it accessible across devices.

- **Scatter Plot Dots**: Circular dots represent each cyclist data point, displaying the corresponding x and y values.

- **Tooltips**: Interactive tooltips provide additional information about each cyclist when hovered.

- **Legend**: A legend distinguishes between cyclists with and without doping allegations.
